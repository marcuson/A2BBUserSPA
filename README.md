# A2BBUserSPA

This project is part of a bigger one, namely Angular 2 Beyond Browser (A2BB), and it is an in-browser Single Page Application (SPA) implementing a self-care panel for a user of the A2BB system.

The projects which are part of A2BB are:
* [A2BBServer](https://github.com/marcuson/A2BBServer)
* [A2BBAdminApp](https://github.com/marcuson/A2BBAdminApp)
* [A2BBUserSPA](https://github.com/marcuson/A2BBUserSPA)
* [A2BBMobileApp](https://github.com/marcuson/A2BBMobileApp)
* [A2BBGranter](https://github.com/marcuson/A2BBGranter)

and they have been developed as a demo to show the potentials of Angular2 - ASP.NET Core - Arduino technologies during a TechItalian meetup
(see [event here](https://www.meetup.com/TechItaliaTuscany/events/237721715)).

For an A2BB system description, please see [A2BBServer](https://github.com/marcuson/A2BBServer).
